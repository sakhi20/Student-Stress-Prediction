DATA CHARACTERISTICS
====================

Sample Size: 500 students
Data Collection: Survey questionnaire
Time Frame: One academic semester
Data Quality: Synthetic data generated for research purposes

Key Relationships:
- CGPA negatively correlated with mental health scores (lower CGPA → higher stress/anxiety/depression)
- Mental health scores are interconnected (high anxiety often accompanies high stress)
- Demographic factors influence mental health patterns

Missing Values: Minimal (<5% in any column)
Outliers: Handled during preprocessing

USAGE NOTES
===========

1. Age and CGPA may contain ranges (e.g., "18-20", "3.0-3.5") - convert to averages
2. Categorical variables need encoding for ML models
3. Mental health labels are derived from computed values
4. Reverse-scored questions (21-24) indicate positive coping
5. This is synthetic data for educational/research purposes

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
======================

- Data privacy: No personally identifiable information
- Informed consent: Required for real survey data
- Mental health sensitivity: Results are not clinical diagnoses
