## 📈 Key Findings

### Correlation Analysis
- **CGPA vs Anxiety:** Strong negative correlation (-0.85)
- **CGPA vs Stress:** Strong negative correlation (-0.83)
- **CGPA vs Depression:** Strong negative correlation (-0.82)

**Interpretation:** Lower CGPA is associated with higher mental health issues.

### Clustering Insights
- **4 distinct student groups** identified
- Clusters differ significantly in CGPA and mental health scores
- Silhouette Score: ~0.45 (moderate cluster quality)

### Model Performance
| Model | Accuracy | Best Feature |

## 🔬 Methodology

### Research Design
- **Type:** Quantitative analysis using survey data
- **Sample Size:** 500 students
- **Data Collection:** Structured questionnaire
- **Analysis:** Descriptive statistics, correlation, clustering, classification

### Limitations
1. **Self-reported data:** Potential response bias
2. **Synthetic dataset:** Generated for research purposes
3. **Cross-sectional:** No longitudinal tracking
4. **Generalizability:** Limited to university students
5. **Sample size:** 500 may not represent all demographics

### Future Work
